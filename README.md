# Heptodes

This is a collection of interrelated projects.  The general plan is to use these
as vehicles for getting up to speed with Rust, as well as investigating some
topics of personal interest.

* *Zebraix* is a set of utilities for handling graphs that can be described as
partially ordered sets with order-dimension 2.

* *Vallary* is a project investigating methods for checking code assurances.

* *Squalor* is a group of experiments in parsing and processing integrated code,
comments and schemas.

* *Patinon* is a project that pulls the other projects together, and will
  experiment with some cross-compilation.
