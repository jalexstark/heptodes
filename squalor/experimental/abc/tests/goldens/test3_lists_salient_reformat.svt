@   Planar graphs(assumed to be DAGs) are graphs that can be drawing without  edge crossings.
@   Every st-planar graph has one source node and one sink node. All nodes can  be reached from
   the source and are able to reach the sink. In other words, there is only one graph and the
   source node is the only one without parents  and the sink node is the only one without
   children. EXTRA CHARACTERS.
@   Often either a source or sink node is not needed. This is the case for  trees, which have a
   root(the source) but no sink. Patinon can extrapolate a  source and/or sink node. The graph
   must be laid out so that all nodes that  are without a parent can be connected to the source,
   and all nodes without a  child can be connected to the sink.
