# Overview of design

## Some distinctions

Zebraix is designed with layered APIs. Zebraix has a distinct set of desiderata.
There are some key essential requirements, and to these some generalizations and
capabilities are added. This sounds a bit fluffy, but the details are in
accompanying documents. While a lot of the design is developed from the core
requirements, there is significant influence from SVG generation and
specifically the Cairo and Pango APIs. There may also be some influence on
choices in the expanded features, though similarities probably arose because
there some common principles.

The drawing side of Zebraix (as opposed to, say, the processing of Jaywalks) is
oriented around one data structure, that is a DAG of *Drawable* nodes. Even the
high-level data structure and associated API for generating are designed with
this in mind. Drawables describe a single drawable entity or a sequence of
segments that are chained to create an open or closed path. We find it helpful
to consider three sets of features. (a) Drawable features that are fairly close
to those in the Cairo API. (b) features that Cairo has that are either not
supported, or that are substantially modified. (c) Features that are more
"distinctively Zebraix".

## Further notes

Not yet incorporated from Cairo:

Context and general:

*   set_miter_limit
*   tolerance
*   clipping / paint
*   pattern fill / source
*   page
*   antialias

Fonts:

*   font_options
*   font_matrix
*   select_font / show_text ("toy" font Cairo)
*   scaled_font (at least not API - may be used for extent calc, etc)
*   font_extents

Path:

*   glyph_path(&self, glyphs: &[Glyph])

To have rough equivalent:

Context:

*   set_source_rgb
*   set_line_width

Font:

*   set_font_size(&self, size: f64)
*   set_font_face(&self, font_face: &FontFace)
*   show_glyphs(&self, glyphs: &[Glyph]) -> Result<(), Error>
*   show_text_glyphs(...) -> Result<(), Error>
*   text_extents(&self, text: &str) -> Result<TextExtents, Error>
*   glyph_extents(&self, glyphs: &[Glyph]) -> Result<TextExtents, Error>

Path:

*   Ellipse arc, ellipse. Most common RQS. arc(&self, xc: f64, yc: f64, radius:
    f64, angle1: f64, angle2: f64)
*   BÃ©zier cubic. curve_to(&self, x1: f64, y1: f64, x2: f64, y2: f64, x3: f64,
    y3: f64)
*   Straight line. line_to(&self, x: f64, y: f64)
*   rectangle(&self, x: f64, y: f64, width: f64, height: f64)
*   text_path(&self, str_: &str)

Also:

*   path_extents(&self) -> Result<(f64, f64, f64, f64), Error>

TAGS:

Not as yet supported, but could be enabled for (a) explicit links and
destinations, and (b) for automatic cross-linking in scenarios where the
embedding of the SVG is known, such as a diagram in an auto-converted doc, such
as Salient.

*   tag_begin(&self, tag_name: &str, attributes: &str)
*   tag_end(&self, tag_name: &str)
