# Notes

The contents of this directory are not generated, for two main
reasons.

1. Reducing storage usage.
2. Because there are concerns about privacy, and so on, such as when
   html calls out to MathJax servers.

With a suitable setup the Makefile in the parent directory can be used
to make html. Look at the Makefile for suggestions on setting the
MathJax environment variable used therein.
