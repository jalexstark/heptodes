# Zebraix test files

## Goldens

A lot of the testing in Zebraix is via end-to-end testing with golden outputs
generated based on golden inputs.  (Only a few examples are generated straight
from code.)  Quite a lot of the tests are generated from real-world examples
that are used as samples or are illustrations in Patinon docs.
